  abstract   = {The distributed transaction commit problem requires reaching agreement on whether
                a transaction is committed or aborted. The classic Two-Phase Commit protocol blocks
                if the coordinator fails. Fault-tolerant consensus algorithms also reach agreement,
                but do not block whenever any majority of the processes are working. The Paxos Commit
                algorithm runs a Paxos consensus algorithm on the commit/abort decision of each participant
                to obtain a transaction commit protocol that uses 2F + 1 coordinators and makes progress
                if at least F + 1 of them are working properly. Paxos Commit has the same stable-storage
                write delay, and can be implemented to have the same message delay in the fault-free
                case as Two-Phase Commit, but it uses more messages. The classic Two-Phase Commit
                algorithm is obtained as the special F = 0 case of the Paxos Commit algorithm.},
