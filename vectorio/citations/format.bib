  abstract  = {Recently, there has been a pressing need to manage high-dimensional vector data in data science and AI applications. This trend is fueled by the proliferation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML), where ML models usually transform unstructured data into feature vectors for data analytics, e.g., product recommendation. Existing systems and algorithms for managing vector data have two limitations: (1) They incur serious performance issue when handling large-scale and dynamic vector data; and (2) They provide limited functionalities that cannot meet the requirements of versatile applications.This paper presents Milvus, a purpose-built data management system to efficiently manage large-scale vector data. Milvus supports easy-to-use application interfaces (including SDKs and RESTful APIs); optimizes for the heterogeneous computing platform with modern CPUs and GPUs; enables advanced query processing beyond simple vector similarity search; handles dynamic data for fast updates while ensuring efficient query processing; and distributes data across multiple nodes to achieve scalability and availability. We first describe the design and implementation of Milvus. Then we demonstrate the real-world use cases supported by Milvus. In particular, we build a series of 10 applications (e.g., image/video search, chemical structure analysis, COVID-19 dataset search, personalized recommendation, biological multi-factor authentication, intelligent question answering) on top of Milvus. Finally, we experimentally evaluate Milvus with a wide range of systems including two open source systems (Vearch and Microsoft SPTAG) and three commercial systems. Experiments show that Milvus is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the competitors while providing more functionalities. Now Milvus is deployed by hundreds of organizations worldwide and it is also recognized as an incubation-stage project of the LF AI & Data Foundation. Milvus is open-sourced at https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus.},

  abstract   = {Analytics is moving to the cloud and data is moving into data lakes. These reside on object storage services like S3 and enable seamless data sharing and system interoperability. To support this, many systems build on open storage formats like Apache Parquet. However, these formats are not optimized for remotely-accessed data lakes and today's high-throughput networks. Inefficient decompression makes scans CPU-bound and thus increases query time and cost. With this work we present BtrBlocks, an open columnar storage format designed for data lakes. BtrBlocks uses a set of lightweight encoding schemes, achieving fast and efficient decompression and high compression ratios.},

  abstract   = {Modern analytical database systems predominantly rely on column-oriented storage, which offers superior compression efficiency due to the nature of the columnar layout. This compression, however, creates challenges in decoding speed during query processing. Previous research has explored predicate pushdown on encoded values to avoid decoding, but these techniques are restricted to specific encoding schemes and predicates, limiting their practical use. In this paper, we propose a generic predicate pushdown approach that supports arbitrary predicates by leveraging selection pushdown to reduce decoding costs. At the core of our approach is a fast select operator capable of directly extracting selected encoded values without decoding, by using Bit Manipulation Instructions, an instruction set extension to the X86 architecture. We empirically evaluate the proposed techniques in the context of Apache Parquet using both micro-benchmarks and the TPC-H benchmark, and show that our techniques improve the query performance of Parquet by up to one order of magnitude with representative scan queries. Further experimentation using Apache Spark demonstrates speed improvements of up to 5.5X even for end-to-end queries involving complex joins.},

  abstract  = {GPUs are increasingly used for high-performance and interactive data analytics workloads due to their capability to accelerate computation using massive parallelism. A key constraint of GPU-based data analytics today is the limited memory capacity in GPU devices.Data compression is a powerful technique that can mitigate the capacity limitation in two ways: (1) fitting more data into GPU memory and (2) speeding up data transfer between CPU and GPU. However, compression schemes for GPU today are still limited in compression ratio and/or decompression speed. We identify two limiting factors of existing approaches. First, existing decompression solutions require multiple passes of scanning the global memory to decode layers of compression schemes, incurring significant memory traffic and hurting performance. We present the tile-based decompression model to decompress encoded data in a single pass over global memory and inline with query execution. Second, we develop an efficient implementation of bit-packing-based compression schemes and their optimization techniques in the context of GPU. Our evaluation shows that our schemes can achieve similar compression rates to the best state-of-the-art compression schemes in GPU (i.e., nvCOMP) while being 2.2\texttimes{} and 2.6\texttimes{} faster in decompression speed and query running time.},
